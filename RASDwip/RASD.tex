\section{Introduction}
    \subsection{Purpose}
        The purpose of the CodeKataBattle platform is to create a friendly and enjoyable environment for students
        to acquire new skills and improve the ones already owned in Software Development. This is done by allowing students to train and compete with each others by writing code in order to resolve problems. All of this under the supervision of educators who can challenge their students to take part to these competitions.
        \subsubsection{Goals}
            \begin{description}
                %Educator's goals
                \item[G1:] \textit{\textbf{Allow educators to create new tournaments:}}
                    \begin{description}
                        \item Educators have the possibility to create new tournaments. 
                            When creating a tournament, educators have the opportunity to create new badges. Badges have corresponding achievements, called "Rules", which are defined on badge creation. Badges are obtained by users on achievement completion. Obtained badges will be then displayed on the user's profile page.
                    \end{description}
                \item[G2:] \textit{\textbf{Allow educators to create new battles:}}
                    \begin{description}
                        \item Educators have the possibility to define new battles within tournament they crated or in tournaments      they have been granted permission to do so. When creating a new battle educators have to set different         parameters:
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item upload project description;
                            \item specify the programming language and build tool to utilize, including test cases and build automation scripts;
                            \item set minimum and maximum number of students per group;
                            \item set a registration deadline;
                            \item set a final submission deadline;
                            \item set additional configuration for scoring.
                        \end{itemize}
                    \end{description}
                    % Assumption: educators can access al tournaments and battles with view only permission
                \item[G3:] \textit{\textbf{Allow educators to administer different tournaments:}}
                    \begin{description}
                        \item Educators can grant other colleagues permission to create new battles in their tournaments. Educators have the possibility to close their tournaments, thus, not letting students submit new answers to any battle defined in the closed tournament, nor letting their colleagues create new battles in that tournament. 
                    \end{description}
                    % Ask if rank visualization is a goal or a user-interface point 
                \item[G4:] \textit{\textbf{Allow educators to administer different battles:}}
                    \begin{description}
                        \item Educators have the possibility, once a battle has expired, to manually evaluate through the platform each student's work, and then assign a corresponding score to each one of them, ranging from 0 to 100. 
                    \end{description}
                %Students' goals
                \item[G5:] \textbf{\textit{Allow students to subscribe in tournaments:}}
                    \begin{description}
                        \item Students subscribed to the platform have the possibility to subscribe to different tournaments, in which they plan to participate in.
                    \end{description}
                    % Assumption: to do anything, both students and educators must be already subscribed to the platform 
                \item[G6:] \textbf{\textit{Allow students to participate in battles:}}
                    \begin{description}
                        \item Students can join battles within a set deadline. They can do so by themselves, by inviting somebody else or by accepting someone's else invite.
                        \begin{description}
                            \item[G6.1:] \textbf{\textit{Allow students to form groups to participate with:}}
                                \begin{description}
                                    \item Students have the possibility to send out invitations to other students, so that they can form a group to participate with. Groups need to follow the guidelines specified by the battle creator for it to be accepted.
                                \end{description}
                            \item[G6.2:] \textit{\textbf{Allow students to submit their answers:}}
                                \begin{description}
                                    \item When students have developed a solution to the battle, they can submit their answer to the platform. Groups are requested to send only one answer. Students can change their answer as they proceed, when uploading a new solution the older one is overwritten, since there can only be one answer for each battle. 
                                \end{description}
                            \item[G6.3:] \textit{\textbf{Allow students to see their scores:}}
                                \begin{description}
                                    \item After each answer submission, a new score is assigned to the students. The score can be manually created by an educator or automatically assigned to the students by the platform. Students can see the scores obtained
                                \end{description}
                        %TODO
                        % Ask professor if score is computated each commit, not visualized, and then published after battle closing, or if students can actively see their scores as the battle progresses (par. 2, last line - par. 4, last line) 
                        \end{description}
                    \end{description}
                \item[G7:] \textit{\textbf{Let the students be notified on important events:}}
                    \begin{description}
                        \item When a new tournament is created, all students subscribed to the platform are notified. A different notification will be sent when a new battle is created in a tournament they are subscribed to.
                        % ask if this goal is correct

\subsection{Scope}
    CodeKataBattle (CKB) is an easy-to-use platform, which aims to allow educators to propose homework and/or lessons in a new and fresh way to involve students more in acquiring and improving software developing skills. To do that, CKB offers educators the possibility to open several tournaments. Each tournament is composed by several battles in which students can compete with each other, individually or in groups. 
    In order to offer all of this CKB relies on the external platform GitHub. GitHub will take the role of a "bridge" between CKB platform and students, allowing them to upload their solutions on it. These solutions will be then taken by the CKB platform from GitHub and used to evaluate student's score in the battle for which they uploaded a specific solution.

\section{Overall description}
    \subsection{Product perspective}
        The following section contains the UML diagram of the platform and a list of meaningful scenarios in which the platform can be used, how and when users can interact with it.
        \subsubsection{Scenarios}
            \subsubsubsection{Student sign up to the platform}
                Peter is a volenterous student of an informatic class, that want to improve his software development skills. He comes to know about the platform CKB one day, when his c.s. professor propose to hhis class, a software development tournament in substitution to the normal, boring and limited tests organized through the academic year.
                Peter is extremely interested, not only in the tournament, but also in the service offered by the platform itself, thus the same day he decide to try to register to it.
                Peter open his personal browser and go to the CKB site's homepage. Here he goes to the student dedicated page and clicks the "Sign up" button in order to register. He inserts all the required information in the mandatory fields of the page that showed up (e.g. name, surname, attended school, email, nickname, password, ...) and clicks on "Confirm" button.
                Peter now wait for the notification, through his email, about the correctness of his registration, and can now access all the CBK platform's features after loggin in with it's credentials.
            \subsubsubsection{Educator sign up to the platform}
                Vittorio is an innovative teacher who teaches c.s. in a school. He discovered, while searching the web for new ideas on how testing his students' abilities in software developing, the CKB platform and its services.
                Vittorio decide to try to register to the platform, as he's very intrigued about it. To do that Vittorio goes on the CKB Homepage and then on the page dedicated to educators and clicks the "Sign up" button. At this point he compiles all the fields in the form that showed up with the new page (e.g. name, surname, school in which he teaches, istitutional email, password, ...), especially the fields related to his profession, and in the end clicks on "Confirm" button.
                Finally Vittorio wait for the registration confirm email, and start using CKB platform's features after loggin in with it's credentials.
            \subsubsubsection{Educator creates a new tournament (and badges)}
                Laura is an c.s. educator who registered to CKB platform. She decide to create a new tournament to let her student compete with each other and improve their software developing skills. In order to do so, Laura log in her account on the platform and try to create a new tournament. While doing so, she decide which programming languages can be used to develop the solution to the battles that will be contained in the tournament, the name of the tournament, the method through which students can access it, eventually its maximum duration, and finally she decide if the tournament will contains some new or default badges, obtainable by the students by doing some achievements.
                Laura wants to create new particular badges, in order to encourage her students to participate more actively to the tournament. To do so, Laura access the appopriate section during tournament creations, and starts creating the badges, specifing their title, rules to obtain them, their icon and eventually their score, that will be added to the student's score that obtained them.
                At the end of the process Laura, confirm her choices and the tournament starts.
            \subsubsubsection{Educator creates a new battle}
                Laura is an c.s educator who registered to the CKB platform. After she created a new tournament, Laura wants to immediately create a new battle within it, to let her students compete with each other. To do so Laura, log in her account on the platform, access the tournament in which she wants to create a new battle through an appropriate web page. At this point Laura try to create a new battle within the tournament. While doing so, she decide the battle's name, the programming language allowed in the battle, maximum number of partecipant, dimension of group of students that can partecipate to it, a registration and submission deadline and eventually sets some personalized rules to calculate students' score in the battle.
                At the end of all of this process, Laura waits for the students of her class, subscribed to the tournament in which the battle has been created, to join the battle. At the end of the registration deadline, partecipant can start competing with each other, while Laura can supervise their work.
                At the end of the battle, which automaticcaly close itself at submission deadline, students' score gets calculated and added to their tournament score.
