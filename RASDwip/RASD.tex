\section{Introduction}
    \subsection{Purpose}
        The purpose of the CodeKataBattle platform is to create a friendly and enjoyable environment for students
        to acquire new skills and improve the ones already owned in Software Development. This is done by allowing students to train and compete with each others by writing code in order to resolve problems. All of this under the supervision of educators who can challenge their students to take part to these competitions.
        \subsubsection{Goals}
            \begin{description}
                %Educator's goals
                \item[G1:] \textit{\textbf{Allow educators to create new tournaments:}}
                    \begin{description}
                        \item Educators have the possibility to create new tournaments. 
                            When creating a tournament, educators have the opportunity to create new badges. Badges have corresponding achievements, called "Rules", which are defined on badge creation. Badges are obtained by users on achievement completion. Obtained badges will be then displayed on the user's profile page.
                    \end{description}
                \item[G2:] \textit{\textbf{Allow educators to create new battles:}}
                    \begin{description}
                        \item Educators have the possibility to define new battles within tournament they crated or in tournaments      they have been granted permission to do so. When creating a new battle educators have to set different         parameters:
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item upload project description;
                            \item specify the programming language and build tool to utilize, including test cases and build automation scripts;
                            \item set minimum and maximum number of students per group;
                            \item set a registration deadline;
                            \item set a final submission deadline;
                            \item set additional configuration for scoring.
                        \end{itemize}
                    \end{description}
                    % Assumption: educators can access al tournaments and battles with view only permission
                \item[G3:] \textit{\textbf{Allow educators to administer different tournaments:}}
                    \begin{description}
                        \item Educators can grant other colleagues permission to create new battles in their tournaments. Educators have the possibility to close their tournaments, thus, not letting students submit new answers to any battle defined in the closed tournament, nor letting their colleagues create new battles in that tournament. 
                    \end{description}
                    % Ask if rank visualization is a goal or a user-interface point 
                \item[G4:] \textit{\textbf{Allow educators to administer different battles:}}
                    \begin{description}
                        \item Educators have the possibility, once a battle has expired, to manually evaluate through the platform each student's work, and then assign a corresponding score to each one of them, ranging from 0 to 100. 
                    \end{description}
                %Students' goals
                \item[G5:] \textbf{\textit{Allow students to subscribe in tournaments:}}
                    \begin{description}
                        \item Students subscribed to the platform have the possibility to subscribe to different tournaments, in which they plan to participate in.
                    \end{description}
                    % Assumption: to do anything, both students and educators must be already subscribed to the platform 
                \item[G6:] \textbf{\textit{Allow students to participate in battles:}}
                    \begin{description}
                        \item Students can join battles within a set deadline. They can do so by themselves, by inviting somebody else or by accepting someone's else invite.
                        \begin{description}
                            \item[G6.1:] \textbf{\textit{Allow students to form groups to participate with:}}
                                \begin{description}
                                    \item Students have the possibility to send out invitations to other students, so that they can form a group to participate with. Groups need to follow the guidelines specified by the battle creator for it to be accepted.
                                \end{description}
                            \item[G6.2:] \textit{\textbf{Allow students to submit their answers:}}
                                \begin{description}
                                    \item When students have developed a solution to the battle, they can submit their answer to the platform. Groups are requested to send only one answer. Students can change their answer as they proceed, when uploading a new solution the older one is overwritten, since there can only be one answer for each battle. 
                                \end{description}
                            \item[G6.3:] \textit{\textbf{Allow students to see their scores:}}
                                \begin{description}
                                    \item After each answer submission, a new score is assigned to the students. The score can be manually created by an educator or automatically assigned to the students by the platform. Students can see the scores obtained
                                \end{description}
                        %TODO
                        % Ask professor if score is computated each commit, not visualized, and then published after battle closing, or if students can actively see their scores as the battle progresses (par. 2, last line - par. 4, last line) 
                        \end{description}
                    \end{description}
                \item[G7:] \textit{\textbf{Let the students be notified on important events:}}
                    \begin{description}
                        \item When a new tournament is created, all students subscribed to the platform are notified. A different notification will be sent when a new battle is created in a tournament they are subscribed to.
                        % ask if this goal is correct

\subsection{Scope}
    CodeKataBattle (CKB) is an easy-to-use platform, which aims to allow educators to propose homework and/or lessons in a new and fresh way to involve students more in acquiring and improving software developing skills. To do that, CKB offers educators the possibility to open several tournaments. Each tournament is composed by several battles in which students can compete with each other, individually or in groups. 
    In order to offer all of this CKB relies on the external platform GitHub. GitHub will take the role of a "bridge" between CKB platform and students, allowing them to upload their solutions on it. These solutions will be then taken by the CKB platform from GitHub and used to evaluate student's score in the battle for which they uploaded a specific solution.

\section{Overall description}
    \subsection{Product perspective}
        The following section contains the UML diagram of the platform and a list of meaningful scenarios in which the platform can be used, how and when users can interact with it.
        \subsubsection{Scenarios}
            \subsubsubsection{Student sign up to the platform}
                Peter is a volenterous student of an informatic class, that want to improve his software development skills. He comes to know about the platform CKB one day, when his c.s. professor propose to his class, a software development tournament in substitution to the normal, boring and limited tests organized through the academic year.
                Peter is extremely interested, not only in the tournament, but also in the service offered by the platform itself, thus the same day he decide to try to register to it.
                Peter open his personal browser and go to the CKB site's homepage. Here he goes to the student dedicated page and clicks the "Sign up" button in order to register. He inserts all the required information in the mandatory fields of the page that showed up (e.g. name, surname, attended school, email, username, password, ...) and clicks on "Confirm" button.
                Peter now wait for the notification, through his email, about the correctness of his registration, and can now access all the CBK platform's features after loggin in with it's credentials.
            \subsubsubsection{Educator sign up to the platform}
                Vittorio is an innovative teacher who teaches c.s. in a school. He discovered, while searching the web for new ideas on how testing his students' abilities in software developing, the CKB platform and its services.
                Vittorio decide to try to register to the platform, as he's very intrigued about it. To do that Vittorio goes on the CKB Homepage and then on the page dedicated to educators and clicks the "Sign up" button. At this point he compiles all the fields in the form that showed up with the new page (e.g. name, surname, school in which he teaches, istitutional email, password, ...), especially the fields related to his profession, and in the end clicks on "Confirm" button.
                Finally Vittorio wait for the registration confirm email, and start using CKB platform's features after loggin in with it's credentials.
            \subsubsubsection{Educator creates a new tournament (and badges)}
                Laura is an c.s. educator who registered to CKB platform. She decide to create a new tournament to let her student compete with each other and improve their software developing skills. In order to do so, Laura log in her account on the platform and try to create a new tournament. While doing so, she decide which programming languages can be used to develop the solution to the battles that will be contained in the tournament, the name of the tournament, the method through which students can access it, eventually its maximum duration, and finally she decide if the tournament will contains some new or default badges, obtainable by the students by doing some achievements.
                Laura wants to create new particular badges, in order to encourage her students to participate more actively to the tournament. To do so, Laura access the appopriate section during tournament creations, and starts creating the badges, specifing their title, rules to obtain them, their icon and eventually their score, that will be added to the student's score that obtained them.
                At the end of the process Laura, confirm her choices and the tournament starts.
            \subsubsubsection{Educator creates a new battle}
                Laura is an c.s educator who registered to the CKB platform. After she created a new tournament, Laura wants to immediately create a new battle within it, to let her students compete with each other. To do so Laura, log in her account on the platform, access the tournament in which she wants to create a new battle through an appropriate web page. At this point Laura try to create a new battle within the tournament. While doing so, she decide the battle's name, the programming language allowed in the battle, maximum number of partecipant, dimension of group of students that can partecipate to it, a registration and submission deadline and eventually sets some personalized rules to calculate students' score in the battle.
                At the end of all of this process, Laura waits for the students of her class, subscribed to the tournament in which the battle has been created, to join the battle. At the end of the registration deadline, partecipant can start competing with each other, while Laura can supervise their work.
                At the end of the battle, which automaticcaly close itself at submission deadline, students' score gets calculated and added to their tournament score.
            \subsubsubsection{Educator close a tournament}
                Marco is an c.s educator who registered to the CKB platform. He has created a new tournament one mounth ago, today, after this mounth he decide to close it. In order to do so, Marco log in his account on the platform and access the tournament which he wants to close through an appropriate web page, at this point Marco control il there are battles that aren't altready closed and sees that Laura has a tournament that is still open, so he now control when is the submission deadline of this battle. After discovering that the submission deadline is in two days he close the possibility of other educators to creates new battles.
                After three days Marco, after log in to the platform, control that there are'n still open battles or battles that are waiting for the manual evaluation. Then he proceed to close the tournament
            \subsubsubsection{Educator manually evaluate a battle after the end}
                Luca is an c.s educator who registered to the CKB platform. He has created a new battle in a tournament two weeks ago, choosing as the submission deadline yesterday and choosing to include a Manual evaluation in the total evaluation of the battle, according to the requirments of shared balaced partecipation, optimization and writing comments related to the code and the implementative choice.
                Today, Luca log in his account on the platform, access to the tournament in which he created the battle and see that this battle is closed and is waiting for a manual evaluation and decide to examine the codes that have been delivered in the battle by the different groups.
                The first group he analyzes is made of three students, and sees that they have a score of 90/100 in the automated evaluation. After entering on the resource made available by the group, Luca check if the number of commits and work has been done equally among the students in the group and not noticing large differences between the number of lines of code written and the number of commit made by each student he decide to go next to the comment section.
                Opening the code in the resource, he relizes that the group has limited himself to adding simple comments, without going to much in the details of the work done and choices made; so he decide to modify the grade assigned befor, by reducing it from 90/100 to 80/100, writing a little explanation of the reason for this change. It then continues to control all the others group and at the end he can close definitively the battle.
            \subsubsubsection{Student forms a group then joins a battle}
                Francesca signs in the platform with her credentials and sees that a new tournament has opened. She would like to participate in it, and so decides to form a group with two of her friends to compete in the tournament's battles. She clicks on the apposite menu and chooses the users she would like to invite to join her group.
                After both her friends accept her invite, she enters the tournament by signing up her group as participant. 
            \subsubsubsection{Student joins a battle}
                Andres is subscribed to a tournament with his group. One day he is notified that a new battle for the tournament he is subscribed to is available.
                After reading the battle's description he decides that he wants to try and join in. He autonomously asks his group members if they want to join the battle too (through email or another external messaging platform).
                After reading their answers, he subscribes the group to the new battle.
                Once the registration deadline for the groups expires, Andres' group forks the automatically created GitHub repository and sets up an automated workflow through GitHub Actions, to notify the platform of each of their commits.
            \subsubsubsection{Student uploads a solution}
                Piero is currently competing with his group in a tournament, they are working on a solution for a battle and they are confident that they are right with what they coded. Piero decides to upload a solution for the battle to the GitHub repository, so that it can be evaluated and they can see how much their score is for this first draft solution.
                Piero uploads the current solution to the forked GitHub repository. After the push, the GitHub Actions workflow is started, letting the platform know that Piero has uploaded a new solution for the battle he's currently competing in.
                The automated evaluation system integrated in the platform now starts, tests are automatically ran and no human evaluation is deemed needed, so the platform gives Piero's solution a score of 75/100.
                Piero sees the score on his profile on the platform and understands that his solution is found correct, but not the best that can possibly be done. He decides to continue working on it, until his solution will obtain a score of at least 95/100.
            \subsubsubsection{Student uploads a solution after deadline expiration time}
                Frank has been competing in a tournament for very long, and has finally found a solution for the last battle he struggled to solve. After having uploaded his solution on the forked repository, the GitHub Actions workflow starts and notifies the platform that Frank's has uploaded a new solution for his final battle.
                The CodeKataBattle platform then sees that the deadline for Frank's battle has expired. The platform notifies Frank that his last uploaded solution will not be considered on the final score he will get, and no further action is taken.
            \subsubsubsection{Students visualize his tournament's results and his badges}
                Paolo, Lucia e Alessandro are three friends that are subscribed in the CKB platform, one evening they decide to compare their tournament's result on the CKB platform. First, they want to compare their result in the last tournament, which ended the day before. 
                Paolo, after logging in the site and entering his profile page, sees that he achived a score of 70/100. Lucia in last tournament was in the same group as Paolo, so she achived the same score. Alessandro, who was in a different group, sees that he has a score of 90/100, thus becoming the best of the three. Lucia now wants to see the best score they have ever achieved, so after logging in the site and searching for her best result, found out that she participated in a tournament two months prior, where she achived a score of 95/100. Alessandro wants to see his best result and after logging in the site, he sees that in his badges there is the "perfect score" badge, which is assigned to a student who got a score of 100/100 in at least one tournament.
                Paolo then wants to know who out of the three has the most badges. After accessing his profile page, he sees that he has obtained a total of 57 badges, obtained in all of the tournaments in which he participated; in this badges Paolo sees that have achived badges for being the most committer of a tournament, one for having partecipated at 50 tournaments and one for having write the most number of code row in a tournament. Alessandro checks that too, and sees that he obtained only 13 badges.
