\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of the CodeKataBattle platform is to create a friendly and enjoyable environment for Students, in which
to improve and acquire skills in Software Development. 
This is done by allowing Students to compete with each other in solving problems through software development.
All of this is done under the supervision of Educators who can challenge students by creating these competitions.
\subsubsection{Goals}
\begin{description}
    \item[G1:] \textit{\textbf{Allow Educators to create new tournaments:}}
          \begin{description}
              \item Educators have the possibility of creting new tournaments.
                    Educators can specify a time limit within whom Students can subscribe to the tournament.
                    Educators can also specify how big Students groups have to be to subscribe in a tournament.
                    When creating a tournament, Educators have the opportunity to create new badges. 
                    Badges have corresponding achievements, called "Rules", which are defined on badge creation. 
                    Badges are obtained by Students on achievement completion. 
                    Obtained badges will be then displayed on the Student's profile page.
          \end{description}
    \item[G2:] \textit{\textbf{Allow Educators to create new battles:}}
          \begin{description}
              \item Educators have the possibility to define new battles within tournaments they have created or in tournaments they have been granted permission to do so. 
              When creating a new battle, Educators have to set different parameters:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item set project description;
                        \item specify the programming language and building tools to utilise, including test cases and build automation scripts;
                        \item set minimum and maximum number of Students per group;
                        \item set a registration deadline;
                        \item set a final submission deadline;
                        \item set additional configurations to evaluate Students' work and compute their score.
                    \end{itemize}

          \end{description}
          \newpage
    \item[G3:] \textit{\textbf{Allow Educators to administer different tournaments:}}
          \begin{description}
              \item Educators can grant other colleagues permission to create new battles in their tournaments. 
              Educators have the possibility to close their tournaments, thus not letting Students submit new answers to any battle defined in the closed tournament,
              nor letting their colleagues create new battles in that tournament.
          \end{description}
          % Ask if rank visualization is a goal or a user-interface point 
    \item[G4:] \textit{\textbf{Allow Educators to administer different battles:}}
          \begin{description}
              \item Educators have the possibility, once a battle has expired and entered the consolidation phase, 
              to manually evaluate, through the platform, each Student's work, they can then assign a corresponding score to each one of them, ranging from 0 to 100.
          \end{description}
    \item[G5:] \textbf{\textit{Allow Students to subscribe in tournaments:}}
          \begin{description}
              \item Students subscribed to the platform have the possibility of subscribing to different tournaments, in which they plan to participate.
          \end{description}
    \item[G6:] \textbf{\textit{Allow Students to participate in battles:}}
          \begin{description}
              \item Students can join battles within a set deadline. They can do so by themselves, by inviting somebody else or by accepting someone else's invite.
                    \begin{description}
                        \item[G6.1:] \textbf{\textit{Allow Students to form groups to participate in battles with:}}
                              \begin{description}
                                  \item Students have the possibility to send out invitations to other Students, so that they can form a group to participate in a battle with.
                                  Groups need to follow the guidelines specified by the battle creator for them to be accepted.
                              \end{description}
                        \item[G6.2:] \textit{\textbf{Allow students to submit their answers to a battle:}}
                              \begin{description}
                                  \item When Students have developed a solution to the battle, they can submit it to the platform. 
                                  Groups are requested to send only one answer. 
                                  Students can change their answer as they proceed. 
                                  When uploading a new solution the older one is overwritten, since there can only be one answer for each battle.
                              \end{description}

                                  \item After each answer submission, a new score is assigned to the Students. 
                                  The score can be manually created by an Educator or automatically assigned to the Students by the platform. 
                                  Students can see the scores obtained in a battle and in a tournament they partecipated in. 
                                  Finally Students can see the badges they obtained in a tournament in their profile page.
                              \end{description}
                              % Ask professor if score is computated each commit, not visualized, and then published after battle closing, or if students can actively see their scores as the battle progresses (par. 2, last line - par. 4, last line)

          \begin{description}
              \item When a new tournament is created, all Students subscribed to the platform are notified of it. 
              A different notification will be sent when a new battle is created in a tournament the Students are subscribed to.

\subsection{Scope}
CodeKataBattle (CKB) is an easy-to-use platform which aims to let Educators propose homework and/or lessons in a new and fresh way. 
The goal is to have Students improve and acquire software developing skills. To do so CKB offers Educators the possibility of opening 
several tournaments. Each tournament is composed by many different battles, in which Students can compete with each other, individually or in groups.
In order to offer all of this, CKB relies on the external platform GitHub. GitHub will take the role of "bridge" between the CKB platform and Students, 
allowing Students to upload their solutions on it. These solutions will then be taken by the CKB platform from GitHub and used to evaluate the Students' scores 
in the battle for which they uploaded a specific solution.

\section{Overall description}
\subsection{Product perspective}
The following section contains the platform's UML diagram and a list of meaningful 
scenarios in which the platform can be used by different users.
\subsubsection{Scenarios}
\subsubsubsection{Student signs up to the platform}
Peter is an IT's student that wants to improve his software development skills. 
He learns about the platform CKB one day, when his c.s. professor proposes to his class a software development tournament 
in substitution to the normal, boring and limited tests organized through the academic year.
Peter is extremely intrigued by the idea and the platform, so much that the same day he decides to try and register to the platform.
Peter opens his personal browser and goes to the CKB site's homepage. Here he navigates to the student's dedicated page and clicks the 
"Sign-up" button in order to register. 
He inserts all the required information in the registration page's mandatory fields(e.g. name, surname, attended school, email, username, password, ...)
 and clicks on a "Confirm" button.
Peter now looks his email homepage for the notification about the correctness of his registration 
and can now access all the CBK platform's features, after loggin in with his credentials.
\subsubsubsection{Educator signs up to the platform}
Vittorio is an innovative computer science's teacher. 
He discovered the CKB platform while searching the web for new testing ideas.
Vittorio decides to register to the platform as he's very intrigued with it. 
To register, Vittorio goes on the CKB's Homepage, then on the page dedicated to educators and clicks the "Sign-up" button.
 After the registration page shows up, he compiles all the fields in the registration form (e.g. name, surname, school in which he teaches, istitutional email, password, ...), 
 especially the ones related to his profession, then clicks on a "Confirm" button.
Vittorio then waits for the registration confirm email and starts using the CKB platform's features, after loggin in with his credentials.
\subsubsubsection{Educator creates a new tournament (and badges)}
Laura is a c.s. educator who registered to CKB platform. She decides to create a new tournament to let her Students compete with each other and improve their software developing skills. 
In order to do so, Laura logs in her account and starts the tournament creation procedure. 
While doing so, she chooses the programming languages to be used when developing the battles' solutions, which will be contained in the tournament, 
the name of the tournament, its maximum duration and finally she decides if the tournament is going to contain some new or default badges,
 obtainable by the students by doing some achievements.
Laura also wants to create new badges in order to encourage her students to participate more actively to the tournament. 
To do so, Laura accesses the appopriate section while creating the tournament and starts creating the badges, specifing their title, the rules to obtain them, their icon and their score, 
that will be added to the Student's score when obtained.
At the end of the process Laura confirms her choices and the tournament starts.
\subsubsubsection{Educator creates a new battle}
Laura is a c.s Educator who registered to the CKB platform. After she created a new tournament, Laura wants to create a new battle within it to let her students compete with each other. 
To do so Laura logs in her account and accesses the tournament in which she wants to create a new battle. 
At this point Laura tries to create a new battle within the tournament. 
While doing so, she decides the battle's name, the programming language allowed in the battle, the dimensions of the students' groups that can partecipate in it, 
a registration and submission deadline and eventually some personalized rules to elaborate students' scores.
Laura then waits for her class' students subscribed to the tournament in which the battle has been created to join the battle. 
At the end of the registration deadline the partecipants can start competing with each other while Laura supervises their work.
At the end of the battle, which is automaticaly closed at submission deadline, the students' work gets evaluated and the battle's score added to their overall tournament score.
\subsubsubsection{Educator closes a tournament}
Marco is a c.s Educator who is registered to the CKB platform. He has created a new tournament a month ago and today, after this month he decides to close it. 
In order to do so, Marco logs in his account and accesses the tournament that he wants to close, at this point Marco controls if there are battles still open. 
Marco notices that Noemi has created a battle in his tournament, and that said battle is still open.
Him being the tournament owner, he can control all battles contained in it. 
He notices that Noemi's battle's submission deadline is in two days, so he decides to wait until the end of her battle before closing his tournament.
After three days Marco, after logging in the platform, checks that there aren't open battles or ones that are waiting for manual evaluation. 
He then proceeds to close the tournament.
\subsubsubsection{Educator manually evaluates a battle after its end}
Luca is a c.s Educator registered to the CKB platform. 
He has created a new battle in a tournament 16 days ago, choosing as the submission deadline 14 days after the battle's creation.
Luca logs in his account on the platform, accesses the tournament in which he created the battle and sees that said battle is closed and waiting for a manual evaluation.
He then decides to examine the solutions that have been submitted by the different groups.
The first group he analyses is composed of three students. He sees that they have a score of 90/100 in the automated evaluation. 
Luca opens the solution proposed by the group, then he checks if the number of commits is equal amongst the students in the group.
Since he doesn't notice any large differences between the number of lines of code written and the number of commits made by each student he decides to go to the comment section.
By looking at the code written by the students, Luca relises that they have not written any specific explanation to the code, and that the overall documentation is very lacking 
in quality and detail. 
Because of this, he decides to modify the previously assigned grade by reducing it from a 90/100 to a 80/100.
He then writes an explanation for this change to the group. 
He then confirms his modifications and goes on evaluating the next group.
When there are no more groups to evaluate, he closes the battle.
\subsubsubsection{Student forms a group}
Francesca signs in the platform with her credentials and sees that, in a tournament in which
she is subscribed, a new battle was created. 
She would like to participate in it and so she decides to form a group with two of her friends to compete in the battle. 
She clicks on the apposite menu and chooses the Students she would like to invite to join her group.
After both her friends accept her invite, the group is correctly formed and now, as group creator,
she can subscribe her group to the battle.
\subsubsubsection{Student joins a battle}
Andres is subscribed to a tournament with his group. One day he is notified that a new battle for the tournament he is subscribed to is available.
After reading the battle's description, Andres decides that he wants to try and join in. He autonomously asks his group members if they want to join
 the battle too (through email or another external messaging platform).
After reading their answers, Andres subscribes the group to the new battle.
Once the registration deadline for the groups expires, Andres' group forks the automatically created GitHub repository and sets 
up an automated workflow through GitHub Actions, to notify the platform of each of their commits.
\subsubsubsection{Student uploads a solution to a battle}
Piero is currently competing with his group in a tournament, they are working on a solution for a battle and they are confident that they are right with what they coded. 
Piero decides to upload a solution for the battle to the GitHub repository, so that it can be evaluated and they can see how much their score is for this first draft solution.
Piero uploads the current solution to the forked GitHub repository. 
After the push, the GitHub Actions workflow is started, letting the platform know that Piero has uploaded a new solution for the battle he's currently competing in.
The automated evaluation system integrated in the platform now starts, tests are automatically ran and no human evaluation is deemed needed, 
so the platform gives Piero's solution a score of 75/100.
Piero sees the score on his profile on the platform and understands that his solution is found correct, but not the best that can possibly be done. 
He decides to continue working on it, until his solution will obtain a score of at least 95/100.
\subsubsubsection{Student uploads a solution after a battle's submission deadline espired}
Frank has been competing in a tournament for a very long time and has finally found a solution for the last battle he struggled to solve. 
After having uploaded his solution on the forked repository, the GitHub Actions workflow starts and notifies the platform that Frank has uploaded a new solution for his final battle.
The CodeKataBattle platform then sees that the deadline for Frank's battle has expired. 
The platform notifies Frank that his last uploaded solution will not be considered on the final score he will get, and no further action is taken.
\subsubsubsection{Students visualise their tournament's results and their badges}
Paolo, Lucia e Alessandro are three friends that are subscribed in the CKB platform, one evening they decide to compare their tournament's result on the CKB platform. 
They want to compare their results in the last tournament, which ended the day before.
Paolo, after logging in the site and navigating to his profile page, sees that he achived a score of 70/100. 
Lucia in last tournament was in the same group as Paolo, so she achived the same score. Alessandro, who was in a different group, sees that he got a score of 90/100, 
thus becoming the best of the three. Lucia now wants to see the best score they have ever achieved, so after logging in the site and searching for her best result, 
she discovered that she participated in a tournament two months prior where she achived a score of 95/100. 
Alessandro wants to see his best result too, and after logging in the site, he sees that in his badges there is the "perfect score" badge, 
which is assigned to a student who got a score of 100/100 in at least one battle.
Paolo then wants to know who out of the three has the most badges. 
After accessing his profile page, Paolo sees that he has obtained a total of 57 badges, obtained in all of the tournaments in which he participated. 
By looking at his badges Paolo notices that he has achieved badges for having the most commits in a battle, for having partecipated in 50 tournaments and 
for having written the most code in a tournament. 
Alessandro checks that too, and sees that he obtained only 13 badges total.

\subsection{Performance requirements}
We expect thousands of registrations to the platform, due to the possible
subscription of several private and public academic environments (especially high schools).
In the subsequent years we expect to have way less subscriptions, since the first year every school and university student
will have the need to subscribe to the platform.
After this first boom of subscriptions, in the subsequent years only new students will have to subscribe, hence there is no need to 
have such a high tolerance in scalability.
There is also to consider the fact that not many people will access the platform at the same time, since once a Student has subscribed 
to a battle, he can work locally and only interact with the GitHub platform.
We expect the CKB platform to be accessed only when a new tournament or battle is created, and when a tournament or a battle is closed,
so that Students can access the platform and check their results. Response time and reliability are our main focuses.
We need to guarantee a low response time in order to let Students and Educators interact actively with the platform
without high delays that could compromise Students' works.
We have to take into consideration reliability since with a low reliability platform when Students upload their solutions on the
forked GitHub repository, triggering GitHub Actions to upload the solutions to the CKB platform, if the CKB platform is not reliable,
it could cause delays in the solution's uploading to the platform.
A low reliable platform can also mean that Student's solutions may not be correctly graded, since the platform may incur in a byzantine failure
type and erroneusly attributes points to some solutions.
Educators would also not be able to access the platform and manually evaluate Students' solutions, and would be a bad experience overall.
For data storing, we expect we'll need a high capacity DB. It's necessary for storing
the user's data, tournaments and battles' data and statistics, informations and code about groups' commits.
We'll need a high capacity DB, since being the platform built around students and schools, we expect to have lots of users subscribing together
at the same time, when school starts. These times are differenciated throught the year, for example in Italy schools starts in Semptember, while in
New Zealand it starts in July. The platform being based around schools means that we'll have lots of user's data related to old students that are
 now not using the platform anymore.
\subsection{Design constraints}
\subsubsection{Hardware constraints}
The users, both Educators and Students, to have access to the platform need to have a functioning internet access and a device connected to the net.
The Educators must have at least a smartphone, so that they can perform all of the different functions the platform offers them, like creating new battles
and tournament, badges and manually evaluate groups' solutions. All of this can be done via browser installed on a smartphone.
The Students are required to have a personal computer, either a desktop or a laptop, such that they can write and submit their solutions to the platform.
Students can access the platform via smartphone too, for consulting their profile and looking at new tournaments and battles, but it would be
best if everything that is concerning to coding and submitting a solution is done via personal computer.
\subsubsection{Privacy constraints}
Since the main application area is the european one, the platform must be compliant to the GDPR's law.
Data must be encrypted before it is saved on the DB, no data must be accessed by any user other than the data's owner.
For preventing cyber attacks, data must pass through secure connections and channels. In this case, no \textit{Man in the Middle} attacks can occur.
Autentication and login will be provided by the CKB platform, so all data must be treated accordingly to the platform's privacy policy.
When a new User, both Educator and Student, wants to register to the platform, the privacy policy must be shown and 
accepted, before the new user is saved in the DB.
If the privacy policy is not accepted, the user registration procedure is not completed and
 the new user is not saved in the DB, not granting access to the person that was
trying to register to the platform.
\subsection{Software system attributes}
\subsubsection{Usability}
The platform must be easy to use. Users must not have doubts on which page to go to perform a precise task.
Each button and link must be named accordingly, to limit time waste and useless interaction with the platform.
\subsubsection{Reliability}
The platform must prevent downtime in order to notify Students of new tournaments or battles as soon as they are created, in order to let
Educators create new tournaments and battles whenever they want and for correctly publish new evaluations and grades on the platform for
Students to see and access.
We expect the highest number of simultaneous access to be whenever schools start and end, since more students will register on school starting,
and more will rush to finish battles and projects as school is ending.
\subsubsection{Availability}
The platform must be available as much as possible, at least 99\% of the time.
Both Students and Educators must have access to the platform whenever they need to.
\subsubsection{Security}
Communication between Users and the Platform must pass through secure channels, and it must be encrypted.
With a web certificate for the platform we can ensure that the SSL protocol is followed, and can ensure security for the platform and its Users.
The DB guarantees that performed operations are all authorized, and permitted.
\textit{A Student cannot create new battles, for example.}
\subsubsection{Web Browsing}
The platform must be usable on any major web browser, since access to it is fully online.
\subsubsection{Maintainability}
The platform must be designed in a way that eases the future adding of new features with the least possible effort.
Maintainability is also key for having a functioning platform, since the easier it is to maintain, the easier errors, 
reliability and availability failures can be corrected.

\color{red}
Every permit gives an Educator who isn't the creator, the possibility of creating new battles inside another Educator's tournament.
The tournament's creator must grant permission to the other Educator, via a permit. (battleCreators)\\
\color{orange}
Every battle is created by an Educator, he can be the tournament's creator or an Educator that has received 
modification permit by the tournament's creator (creator) [Ex. Battle0 is created by Educator1 in 
Tournament2, that is created by Educator0. Educator0 grants Educator1 Permit0 so that Educator1 can create Battle0 in Tournament2 ]\\
\color{green}
Every tournament can be created by only one Educator (creator)\\
\color{blue}
Tests may be reused amonst more battles, while a test has to be relative to at least one battle, it can be utilized by more than one (tests)\\
\color{violet}
A battle is only in one tournament (tournament)\\
\color{red}
A permission is relative to one tournament created by an Educator (tournament)\\
\color{brown}
A permission can only be granted by an Educator that created at least one tournament (tournamentCreator)\\
